SITE INFORMATION


 
 
 
 
      ALBH is a continuously tracking GNSS site. This station is part of the Western Canada Deformation Array (WCDA) as well as the Canadian Active Control System(CACS). Station is located near Victoria, British Columbia.

The GNSS reference mark consists of a brass plate with a forced centered stainless steel bolt. 
The brass plate is embedded on top of a 3.0 m high concrete pier, 0.600 m in diameter.
 The concrete pier is anchored to  bars to a depth of 0.6 m.
 The antenna is

Note(s):

The coordinates above are the most accurately known positions for this station relative to the NAD83CSRS coordinate system. Although these coordinates are very accurate within the Canadian Spatial Reference System and with respect to the defined NAD83 datum, they may not be consistent with NAD83 coordinates officially adopted and published by provincial agencies for monumented geodetic control points.

CGVD28 - Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum 1928, mean sea level (adopted, public vertical reference system). The average height of the surface of the sea for all stages of the tide. Usually determined by averaging height readings observed hourly over a minimum period of 19 years.
