SITE INFORMATION


    
 
                      CHWK is a continuously tracking GNSS site. This station is part of the Western Canada Deformation Array (WCDA) as well as the Canadian Active Control System (CACS). Station is located in Chilliwack,  British Columbia.

 The GPS reference mark consists in a
 stainless steel plate with a forced centered
 bolt. 
The stainless steel plate is the top
 surface of a 1.2 m high stainless steel pedestal,
 0.152 m in diameter, mounted on top of a concrete water
 reservoir. 
The pedestal is 1.2 metres high,
 15.2 cm in diameter.
 The antenna is fastened  
 
 
 
  
 
 pedestal, tamper resistant mechanism, etc..

Note(s):

The coordinates above are the most accurately known positions for this station relative to the NAD83CSRS coordinate system. Although these coordinates are very accurate within the Canadian Spatial Reference System and with respect to the defined NAD83 datum, they may not be consistent with NAD83 coordinates officially adopted and published by provincial agencies for monumented geodetic control points.

CGVD28 - Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum 1928, mean sea level (adopted, public vertical reference system). The average height of the surface of the sea for all stages of the tide. Usually determined by averaging height readings observed hourly over a minimum period of 19 years.
